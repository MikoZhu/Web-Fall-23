      <h2>What is an HTML Form?</h2>
      <p>
        An HTML form is a way to gather information from users on a webpage. It
        provides a structured way for users to input data, such as text,
        numbers, choices, and more.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Use HTML Forms?</h2>
      <p>
        HTML forms are essential for interactive web applications, as they allow
        users to submit data to a server for processing. They enable various
        actions, from submitting comments to making purchases or signing up for
        services.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Create an HTML Form:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Structure: Use the ;form; element to define the form structure.</li>
        <li>

          or GET).
        </li>
