// Intro to JS Conditionals

// What are Conditionals:
// In JavaScript, conditionals are like decision-making tools for your code. They help your program decide what to do based on certain conditions. Just like making choices in real life, conditionals guide your code down different paths depending on what's happening.

// Why Use Conditionals:
// Conditionals are essential because they make your code smarter and more adaptable. They allow your program to respond to different situations dynamically, providing a personalized experience for users. Without conditionals, your code would follow the same instructions regardless of what's going on, which isn't always helpful.

// How Conditionals Work:
// Conditionals have 3 different approaches within JS
// - If Statements
// - Switch Case Statement
// - Ternary Operators
