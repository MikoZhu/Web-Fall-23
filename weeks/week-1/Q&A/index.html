      <p>Question:</p>
      <p>
        The specification says, a main tag should always be followed by a h1,
        but sometimes you don't have a heading, start with something else. Diego
        did not use an h1 in his last coding lesson as well. Is it bad style if
        you not use h1 as first successor, or does it not matter actually? Thank
        you!
      </p>
      <p>Answer:</p>
      <p>
        In the context of a beginner student learning about HTML, it's not an
        absolute requirement to always add an h1 directly below the main tag.
        The specification recommends this structure for accessibility and
        semantic reasons, as it helps provide a clear hierarchical structure to
        web content. When a screen reader or search engine parses a webpage, it
        relies on headings to understand the organization and hierarchy of the
        content. Placing an h3 directly below the main tag signifies the main
        heading of the content within the main section. However, there are
        situations where you might not have a meaningful h1 heading to place
        directly under main, especially when the content doesn't require a
        heading. In such cases, you can still use other heading levels, such as
        h2, h3, etc., based on the content's structure. The key takeaway is that
        while it's a good practice to use headings for semantic structure and
        accessibility, there might be scenarios where you don't need a main
        heading immediately after the main tag. It's essential to balance
        adherence to best practices with the actual needs and structure of your
        content.

      <p>Answer:</p>
      <p>
        Both approaches are valid and have their use cases. The decision depends
        on the complexity and reusability of the styles. If the differences
        between the items are minimal and the styles are reusable, using a
        single class with overrides might be more efficient. On the other hand,
        if the items have more substantial differences and you want to maintain
        clear separation of styles, using separate classes might be a better
        choice. Consider your specific design needs and the potential for future
        changes when making this decision.

        Built a form with a custom checkbox. All real input elements get a

        default blue color. Somehow takes primary color. Is there a way to set
        outline color to default? Thank you!

        >
      </p>
      <p>Answer:</p>
      <p>
        Yes, there's a way to set the outline color back to the default. The
        default outline color that browsers apply when an element is focused is
        usually a shade of blue. To achieve this default outline color, you can
        simply remove any custom outline styles you've added. If you haven't
        applied any custom outline styles, the browser's default behavior will
        automatically handle the outline color for focused elements, including
        checkboxes. Here's the key point: If you want the default outline color,
        avoid adding any specific outline styles in your CSS for the element.
        This way, the browser will handle the default outline color when the
        element is focused.

      <p>Question:</p>
      <p>
        Is console.log only used to se how the code works and should not be in
        the finished result?
      </p>
      <p>Answer:</p>
      <p>
        Absolutely, you're on the right track! console.log is primarily used for
        debugging and understanding how your code is working. It's incredibly
        useful during development to inspect values, variables, and the flow of
        your program. However, in the finished version of your code that you're
        ready to share or deploy, it's recommended to remove or comment out
        unnecessary console.log statements. Leaving them in the final code can
        clutter the console and potentially reveal sensitive information to
        users. So, while console.log is a powerful tool for development, it's a
        good practice to clean up your code before sharing or publishing it to
        ensure a polished and professional end result.

      <p>Question:</p>
      <p>
        "Questions about JS code in the example of festival reservation: Why did
        you use an array to store the artist names (line 60, 68, 76)? In
        general, when should we use array vs conditional statements to go
        through the options? Why is there no ""else"" in your ""if"" statements
        at the end of the file (line 102-114)?"
      </p>
      <p>Answer 1:</p>
      <p>
        In code, artist names are associated with each concert slot option for a
        particular genre. By using an array, the code becomes more readable and
        maintainable, especially when there are multiple slots and artist names
        to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, using arrays is preferred when you have a set of related
        data that you want to access or manipulate together. Conditional
        statements are more suitable when you have distinct cases that require
        different behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>Answer 2:</p>
      <p>
        The absence of an "else" statement in the final set of "if" statements
        (lines 102-114) is due to the fact that these statements are handling
        specific cases for each concert slot choice. In this scenario, the code
        is using separate "if" or "else if" branches to handle each valid
        concert slot choice individually. Since each concert slot choice is
        exclusive (only one will match), there's no need for an "else"
        statement. If an "else" statement were used in this context, it would
        execute only if none of the previous conditions matched. However, that
        wouldn't make sense in this case because there are only three specific
        slot choices, and each "if" or "else if" branch handles a distinct
        choice.

      <p>Question:</p>
      <p>
        Example festival reservation, file index.js, line 50: shouldn't it be:
        "let artistNames = [];" as you want to initialize an array?
      </p>
      <p>Answer:</p>
      <p>
        You're absolutely correct in your observation. It's important to
        remember that coding, like many creative endeavors, is subjective in
        nature. Mistakes or oversights can easily occur, even when there's a
        clear intention behind the code. In this specific case, the comment
        signifies the intent to initialize an array for storing artist names,
        yet the variable is mistakenly being assigned an empty string ("")
        instead of the intended empty array ([]). My fault :)

      <p>Question:</p>
      <p>Do we need "break;" in default case?</p>
      <p>Answer:</p>
      <p>
        No, you don't need to include a "break;" statement in the default case.
        In a switch case structure, the "break;" statement is used to exit the
        switch block and prevent code execution from "falling through" to the
        next case. In the default case, the "break;" statement is not required
        because it's the last case in the switch block. After the default case's
        code is executed, the control naturally exits the switch block without
        needing an explicit "break;" statement.

      <p>Question:</p>
      <p>
        Can you explain the use of true as an expression inside a switch case? I
        had a situation with two cases, where one checked if age is equal to or
        over 18 and the other if the age was under 18. When I put an expression
        “customerAge” with in the switch it constantly when directly to the
        default, but when I put in true as the expression instead, it worked.
      </p>
      <p>Answer:</p>
      <p>
        Your observation is accurate, In your situation, you're using it to
        handle two different cases: one for customers who are 18 or older and
        another for customers who are under 18. The switch case with true as the
        expression allows you to compare multiple conditions within the same
        block and execute the appropriate case based on the outcome of those
        conditions. In your code, you're checking whether customerAgeInt is
        greater than or equal to 18 or less than 18, and then proceeding with
        the appropriate actions for each case.
      </p>
      <p>
        This usage simplifies your code by allowing you to manage both adult and
        child scenarios within the same switch case structure. Without using
        true, you might need to use separate if statements or nested switch
        cases to achieve the same result.

      <p>Question:</p>
      <p>
        I noticed in the festival reservation example that you use const for
        some variables and let for others. I understand that const variables
        can't be reassigned or redeclared, while let variables can be reassigned
        but not redeclared. Is there a specific reason why you chose const for
        for example the userName prompt while using let for others like
        selectedGenre?
      </p>
      <p>Answer:</p>
      <p>
        Here, I've used const to declare the userName variable. Since I want to
        store the user's name, which won't change, using const is appropriate.
        Basically, since the value of the variable is always the same, "a prompt
        method", there is no need to store it in a let but it's still subjective
        ;)
