// What is Javascriot ?

// JavaScript is a programming language that allows web developers to add interactivity and functionality to their websites. It's executed directly in a web browser and enables you to control how elements on a webpage behave and respond to user actions. JavaScript is a crucial tool for creating dynamic and engaging web experiences.

// Why JavaScript?
// JavaScript is essential because it brings websites to life. Without it, web pages would be static and lack interaction. This is done through a concept called a JIT Compiler, which means "Just in Time"

// What is a compiler
// Imagine a compiler as a special tool that turns fancy code made by us programmers into simple instructions that computers can follow. This happens through something called Just-In-Time Compilation, where a browser's engine changes the human-friendly code into a super-efficient version that makes things work better on the computer.
