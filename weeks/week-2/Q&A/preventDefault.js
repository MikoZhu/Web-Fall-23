// Here's a simple breakdown:

// What does event.preventDefault() do?
// Stops Default Behavior: It prevents the browser's default action associated with the event.
// Common Scenarios:
// Form Submission: When a form is submitted, the default behavior is to send a request (usually to a server). If you want to handle the form submission with JavaScript and, for example, send the data using AJAX, you'd use event.preventDefault() to stop the form from submitting in the traditional way.

document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Handle the form data here with JavaScript
});

// Links: If you have a link(<a>) and you don't want it to navigate to its href when clicked (maybe because you want to handle the click with JavaScript), you'd use event.preventDefault().

document.querySelector("a").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Handle the click action here with JavaScript
});
{
  /* In Simpler Terms:
Imagine you're at a cafe, and every time you snap your fingers, a waiter brings you a cup of coffee. That's their default response to your snapping. Now, if you wanted to snap your fingers to the beat of a song without getting coffee every time, you'd tell the waiter, "Hey, when I snap my fingers this time, don't bring coffee." That's what event.preventDefault() does; it tells the browser not to do its usual thing when the event happens. */
