By keeping data at the top, in app.jsx, it makes sharing and managing information easier across different parts of our app. This way of sharing data might seem a bit tricky at first, but it's really important to learn before we get into more advanced ways of managing data, which we'll cover later on. `,

          "Keeping data at the top level, often referred to as 'lifting state up,' is not only good for managing and sharing information but also for maintaining a clean and efficient application structure. It allows for a single source of truth, meaning your data lives in one place, making it easier to debug and manage state changes. This approach ensures that components are synchronized and consistent throughout the application, reducing the risk of errors and discrepancies. So, mastering this concept of top-level state data is a significant step in becoming proficient in React development!",
