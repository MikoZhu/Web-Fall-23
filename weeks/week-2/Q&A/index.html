      <p>I cannot understand what a closuers is. Can you explain it?</p>
      <p class="question">Answer</p>
      <p>
        A closure in programming refers to a function that retains access to its
        outer scope's variables even after the outer function has finished
        executing. In simpler terms, it's like a function with a memory of the
        environment in which it was created.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What is "Environment" in the Context of Closures?</strong></p>
      <p>
        When we talk about a function's "environment" in the context of
        closures, we're referring to the surroundings or conditions in which the
        function was created. Specifically, this means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Variables: Any variables that were available and in scope when the
          function was defined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Functions: Any other functions that were in scope when our function
          was defined.
        </li>
        <li>Parameters: Any parameters of the outer function.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In essence, the "environment" is like the backdrop or setting where the
        function was born. Just like how a person might remember their childhood
        home, a closure "remembers" the environment where it was created.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How do closures work</strong></p>
      <p>
        When a function is defined inside another function, it forms a closure
        by "remembering" the environment in which it was created. This
        environment includes any local variables, parameters, and other inner
        functions. This "memory" is retained even after the outer function
        completes its execution.
      </p>
      <p>Example</p>
      <p>Take a look into closure.js</p>
      <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
      <button id="myButtonTwo">Say Hello</button>

      <p class="question">Question</p>
      <p>
        Speaking in code? Is it a skill which we develope throughout the
        bootcamp (underlying in the process) i.e. the more we learn, the more we
        can speak code or do I have to take on a side hobby to learn speaking
        code? Any tips?
      </p>
      <p class="question">Answer</p>
      <p>
        Speaking in code" typically refers to the ability to discuss, describe,
        and communicate ideas, problems, and solutions using programming
        concepts, terminologies, and sometimes even pseudo-code or actual code
        snippets. It's an essential skill for developers, especially when
        collaborating with others.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Is it a skill developed throughout at Technigo? </strong></p>
      <p>Yes</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Do you need a side hobby to learn to speak in code? </strong>

      </p>
      <p><strong>Tips?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice: Just as with coding itself, practice is key.</li>
        <li>
          Engage in Code Reviews: Actively participate in code reviews, both as
          a reviewer and a reviewee.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pseudo-code: Before diving into coding, try writing out the logic in
          pseudo-code. It's a simplified, often plain-English version of the
          logic you want to implement. This practice can help you think through
          problems and articulate solutions more clearly.
        </li>
        <li>Stay Curious</li>
        <li>Engage with the Community</li>
        <li>
          Instagram has shifted to a more educational content based since tiktok
          so its a cool tool as well. Look up specific tags like "js"
          "javascript" "html" "css" "react" and soon you will train your
          algorithim to feed you accts give you tips and examples

      <p class="question">Question</p>
      <p>
        I am not sure, if there is a situation in which I need an event handler
        and a parameter in one function. Is there any case like that? If so, how
        to pass a parameter to an event handler?
      </p>
      <p class="question">Answer</p>
      <p>
        Yes, there are situations where you might want to pass additional
        parameters to an event handler. For instance, if you have a generic
        function that handles events for multiple elements and you want to
        differentiate the behavior based on which element was clicked, or if you
        want to pass some additional data to the function.
      </p>

      <p class="question">Question?</p>
      <p>Do we need to use strict mode?</p>
      <p class="question">Answer</p>
      <p>Yes</p>
      <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Imagine you're playing a game, and there are two modes: Casual Mode and
        Strict Mode.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In Casual Mode, the game is forgiving. If you make a small mistake or
          do something not exactly right, the game lets it slide. It's
          easy-going.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Strict Mode, the game is less forgiving. If you make a mistake or
          don't follow the rules exactly, the game will immediately let you
          know. It's more disciplined.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, "strict mode" is like the second mode of the game. It
        makes the language stricter. If you write code that's a bit sloppy or
        uses some bad practices, JavaScript in strict mode will point it out by
        throwing errors or warnings.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Is it recommended for beginners? Why? </strong></p>
      <p>Yes, it's recommended, especially for beginners. Here's why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Catches Common Mistakes: Strict mode helps catch common coding
          mistakes that might otherwise be ignored. For a beginner, this is
          valuable feedback to learn the right way to code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prevents Bad Practices: There are some features in JavaScript that can
          be confusing or lead to errors. Strict mode restricts or throws errors
          for these, guiding beginners away from potential pitfalls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safer Code: Code written in strict mode is generally safer, making it
          less prone to bugs and issues.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong
          >To use strict mode, simply add the line 'use strict'; at the top of
          your JavaScript file or script. It's a small step that can make a big
          difference in the quality of your code.</strong

      <p>
        Could you do a short explanation of the console again please? When to
        use it, how and why?
      </p>
      <p class="question">Answer</p>
      <p><strong>What is console.log()? </strong></p>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, console.log() is a method that outputs information to the
        web browser's console. It's a part of the console object, which provides
        access to the browser's debugging conso
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to Use console.log()? </strong></p>
      <p>Let's take a look at the console.js file</p>
      <p><strong>When to Use console.log()?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Debugging:</strong> It's a quick and simple way to check the
          value of variables, the flow of code, or the output of functions
          during development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning:</strong> When learning JavaScript, it's useful to
          see the results of your code immediately. console.log() provides
          instant feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitoring:</strong> In more advanced scenarios, you might use
          it to monitor certain events or behaviors in your code, especially
          when other debugging tools might be overkill or not available.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why Use console.log()?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Simplicity:</strong> It's straightforward and doesn't require
          any setup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Universality:</strong> It works in all major browsers and
          JavaScript environments, like Node.js.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can log strings, numbers, objects,
          arrays, and more. It can also be used with string interpolation or
          template literals for more complex outputs.

        What's the difference between innerHTML, innerText and textContent and

      </p>
      <p class="question">Answer</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use innerHTML when dealing with HTML content.</li>
        <li>Use innerText when you want only the visible text.</li>
        <li>Use textContent when you want all the text, visible or not.</li>

        <button onclick="modifyHTMLContent()">Modify HTML Content</button>
        <p>When you click the button, the content of the div will change, and the new content will include an <em> tag.</p>

          <button onclick="showVisibleText()">Show Visible Text</button>
          <p>When you click the button, the alert will show an empty string because the text inside the div is hidden using CSS, and innerText only considers visible text.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p><strong>Using textContent when you want all the text, visible or not:
          </strong></p>
          <div id="contentExample" style="display: none;">This text is also hidden.</div>
          <button onclick="showAllText()">Show All Text</button>    
          <p>When you click the button, the alert will show "This text is also hidden." even though the text inside the div is hidden using CSS. This is because textContent gets all the text, regardless of its visibility.</p>

      <p class="question">Question</p>
      <p>Should I always try to use arrow functions or are there situations where the traditional function's syntax is better?</p>
      <p class="question">Answer</p>
      <p> <strong>Start with Function Declarations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Familiarity</strong>: For those new to JavaScript, function declarations are more familiar and are often introduced early in learning materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Function declarations make it clear you're defining a function, enhancing readability, especially for beginners.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Consider Switching to Arrow Functions:</strong></p>    
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Conciseness</strong>: Arrow functions offer a shorter syntax, especially for small functions or callbacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Code</strong>: Arrow functions are frequently used in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries, making your code feel updated.</li>

      <p>"I don't understand this line in the code that was provided in the chat bot project: 
        event.preventDefault();
        What does it do?"</p>
      <p class="question">Answer</p>
      <p>The event.preventDefault() method stops the default action of an event from happening. When you have an event listener on an element, and that event is triggered, the browser will often have a default behavior associated with that event. By calling event.preventDefault(), you're telling the browser, "Don't do your default thing."</p>
