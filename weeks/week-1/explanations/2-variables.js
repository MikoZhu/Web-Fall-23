// Variables

// What are Variables in JavaScript?
// In JavaScript, variables are like containers that hold information. They let you store different kinds of data, such as numbers, text, or more complex things like lists of items. Think of variables as labeled boxes where you can put stuff to use later.

// Why Use Variables in JavaScript?
// Variables are used to remember and manage information in a program. Instead of repeating the same value over and over, you can use a variable to store that value once and then use the variable name whenever you need it. This makes your code cleaner, easier to understand, and more flexible to change.
